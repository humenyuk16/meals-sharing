## WHAT I LEARNED

During the development of this project, I faced several challenges that helped me learn new skills and technologies. Some of the challenges I faced include deploying a React application, creating a Modal component, and migration to PostgreSQL.
Through these challenges, I was able to gain a better understanding of React, CSS Modules, and Frontend Development in general. I also learned how to work with Express.js, KnexJS, and PostgreSQL to build a full-stack web application.
In addition to these technical skills, I also learned how to manage my time effectively and prioritize tasks to meet deadlines.
Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me and helped me grow as a developer.
